🎯 AI CODING PROMPT — PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

Project Title: Stunning Rave-Themed Developer Portfolio
Project Type: Full-Stack Personal Portfolio Website
Goal: Build a visually stunning, modern, interactive portfolio website with a unique rave-inspired aesthetic, smooth animations, and 3D elements.

🧠 OVERVIEW

Create a fully responsive, full-stack personal portfolio website using a modern JavaScript stack. The site must be highly visual, animated, and immersive, with a futuristic rave / neon cyberpunk aesthetic. It should feel energetic, premium, and creative — not a basic template.

The website should showcase a developer’s profile, skills, experience, and projects in an engaging, interactive way.
